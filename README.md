# Practice-Terraform

This Terraform code (practice.tf) provisions an EC2 instance with a web server running on it, 
along with necessary networking configurations like VPC, subnet, and security groups. 
Additionally, it creates an S3 bucket and configures IAM policies and roles to grant the EC2 instance access to the S3 bucket.
